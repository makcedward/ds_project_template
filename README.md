After working data science projects, found that project strucure is important for team communication and project deliver. You may visit my blog for more detail. 

Here is the explantation of folder strucure:
- src: Source python code
- test: Test case for asserting python source code
- model: Storing intermediate result in here only. For long term, it should be stored in model repository separately.
- data: Temporary local data repository
- notebook: Source notebook code
